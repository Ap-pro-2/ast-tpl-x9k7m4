## How to Taste Coffee

### Step 1: Smell First
Aroma is 80% of flavor. Take deep inhales before tasting.

Aerating coffee spreads it across your palate - don't be shy!

## Developing Your Palate

### Practice Regularly
Taste different coffees side by side to notice differences.

### Use References
Compare to familiar flavors - "tastes like dark chocolate" or "reminds me of oranges."

### Keep Notes
Write down what you taste - it helps train your memory.

### Start Simple
Begin with basic descriptors: sweet, bitter, sour, salty.

## Common Beginner Mistakes
- Expecting wine-like complexity immediately
- Focusing only on negative aspects
- Not considering brewing method effects
- Tasting when coffee is too hot

## Professional Tips
- Taste at different temperatures
- Try the same coffee with different brewing methods
- Cleanse palate with water between tastings
- Practice with friends - discussion helps

Your palate develops over time. Trust your taste buds and have fun exploring!
