# French Press Brewing Guide - Rich and Full-Bodied Coffee

The French press is perfect for those who love rich, full-bodied coffee with minimal effort. This immersion brewing method extracts oils and fine particles that paper filters remove, creating a robust cup.

## What You Need
- French press
- Coarse ground coffee
- Hot water (200Â°F)
- Timer

## The Perfect Ratio
Use 1:15 ratio - 1g coffee to 15g water. For most French presses, that's about 30g coffee to 450g water.

## Brewing Steps
1. **Preheat** - Rinse French press with hot water
2. **Add coffee** - Coarse grind, like breadcrumbs
3. **Add water** - Pour hot water, stir gently
4. **Steep** - Wait 4 minutes exactly
5. **Press & serve** - Press plunger slowly, serve immediately

## Pro Tips
- Use freshly roasted beans (2-4 weeks old)
- Grind just before brewing
- Don't over-steep - it gets bitter
- Clean thoroughly after each use

The French press rewards you with rich, complex flavors that showcase your coffee's natural oils and character!
