# Guatemala Huehuetenango - Single Origin Spotlight

Nestled in the western highlands of Guatemala, the Huehuetenango region produces some of the most exceptional coffee beans in Central America. With its unique terroir and dedicated farmers, this region crafts coffees that are both complex and approachable.

## The Huehuetenango Region

Huehuetenango (pronounced "way-way-ten-AN-go") is Guatemala's highest and most remote coffee-growing region:

- **Elevation**: 1,500-2,000 meters above sea level
- **Climate**: Dry, hot winds from Mexico's Tehuantepec plain
- **Soil**: Rich volcanic soil with excellent drainage
- **Harvest**: December to March

## What Makes Huehuetenango Special

### Unique Geography
The region's isolation from Guatemala's volcanic activity means the soil composition is different from other Guatemalan coffee regions. The limestone-rich soil combined with high altitude creates ideal growing conditions.

### Climate Advantages
Hot, dry winds from Mexico keep the coffee plants healthy by preventing fungal diseases common in other tropical regions. The large temperature variations between day and night help develop complex sugars in the beans.

### Traditional Farming
Most farms are family-owned and operated using traditional methods passed down through generations. This attention to detail shows in every cup.

## Flavor Profile

Huehuetenango coffees are known for their:

**Acidity**: Bright, wine-like acidity that's crisp but not overwhelming

**Body**: Medium to full body with excellent balance

**Flavor Notes**:
- Dark chocolate
- Caramel sweetness
- Citrus brightness (orange, lemon)
- Floral undertones
- Spicy finish with hints of cinnamon

**Aroma**: Fragrant with floral and fruity notes

## Processing Methods

### Washed Process
Most Huehuetenango coffee is washed (wet-processed):
1. Cherries are pulped to remove fruit
2. Beans ferment in water for 24-48 hours
3. Thorough washing removes remaining mucilage
4. Beans dry on patios or raised beds

This process enhances the bright, clean flavors that Huehuetenango is famous for.

## Brewing Recommendations

To highlight Huehuetenango's complexity:

### Pour Over (V60 or Chemex)
- **Ratio**: 1:16 (coffee to water)
- **Grind**: Medium-fine
- **Temperature**: 200°F
- **Time**: 3-4 minutes
- Perfect for showcasing bright acidity

### French Press
- **Ratio**: 1:15
- **Grind**: Coarse
- **Time**: 4 minutes
- Emphasizes body and chocolate notes

### Espresso
- **Ratio**: 1:2
- **Grind**: Fine
- **Time**: 25-30 seconds
- Creates complex shots with caramel sweetness

## Roasting Notes

**Light Roast**: Preserves origin characteristics, bright acidity, floral notes

**Medium Roast**: Balanced sweetness and acidity, caramel development

**Medium-Dark**: Reduced acidity, increased body, chocolate prominence

Avoid dark roasting as it masks the unique terroir characteristics.

## Farming Community

The Huehuetenango region is home to indigenous Mam people who have cultivated coffee for generations. Many cooperatives work directly with farmers to ensure:

- Fair pricing for quality coffee
- Sustainable farming practices
- Community development projects
- Preservation of traditional methods

## Seasonal Availability

- **Harvest**: December - March
- **Arrival**: April - June
- **Best drinking**: May - October
