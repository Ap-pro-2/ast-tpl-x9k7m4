# Mastering Pour Over Techniques for Perfect Coffee

Pour over coffee brewing is an art form that rewards patience and precision. When done correctly, it produces some of the cleanest, most flavorful coffee you can make at home. Let's dive into the techniques that will elevate your pour over game.

## Essential Equipment

Before we begin, you'll need:
- Pour over dripper (V60, Chemex, or Kalita Wave)
- Paper filters
- Gooseneck kettle
- Digital scale
- Fresh coffee beans
- Grinder

## The Perfect Grind

The grind size for pour over should be medium-fine, similar to kosher salt. Too fine, and you'll over-extract; too coarse, and you'll under-extract. Consistency is key for even extraction.

## Water Temperature Matters

Aim for water temperature between 195°F and 205°F (90°C to 96°C). If you don't have a thermometer, let boiling water sit for 30 seconds before pouring.

## The Brewing Process

1. **Pre-wet the filter** - Rinse with hot water to remove papery taste
2. **Add coffee** - Use a 1:16 ratio (1g coffee to 16g water)
3. **Bloom** - Pour 2x the coffee weight in water, wait 30 seconds
4. **Pour in circles** - Slow, steady spirals from center outward
5. **Control timing** - Total brew time should be 3-4 minutes

## Pro Tips for Better Extraction

- Keep pouring motion consistent
- Maintain water level in dripper
- Pour slowly and steadily
- Practice makes perfect

Master these fundamentals, and you'll be brewing café-quality coffee at home in no time!
