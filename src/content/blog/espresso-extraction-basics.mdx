# Espresso Extraction Basics - Pull Perfect Shots Every Time

Espresso is the foundation of countless coffee drinks, but pulling a perfect shot requires understanding the key variables that affect extraction.

## The Golden Rules
- **Dose**: 18-20g of coffee
- **Yield**: 36-40g espresso (1:2 ratio)
- **Time**: 25-30 seconds
- **Grind**: Fine, like powdered sugar

## Key Variables

### Grind Size
Too fine = over-extraction (bitter, slow)
Too coarse = under-extraction (sour, fast)

### Tamp Pressure
Apply 30lbs pressure with level, straight tamp. Consistency matters more than force.

### Water Temperature
Ideal range: 200-203°F. Most machines are pre-calibrated.

## Dialing In Your Shot
1. Start with baseline recipe
2. Adjust grind size first
3. Modify dose if needed
4. Time should fall into place

## Signs of Good Extraction
- Golden honey-colored crema
- Steady, even flow
- Sweet, balanced flavor
- No sourness or excessive bitterness

Perfect espresso takes practice, but understanding these fundamentals will get you pulling café-quality shots at home!
