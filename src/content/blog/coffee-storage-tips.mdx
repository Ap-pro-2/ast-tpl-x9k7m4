# Coffee Storage Tips - Keep Your Beans Fresh Longer

Proper storage is crucial for maintaining coffee's peak flavor. Here's how to keep your beans fresh for weeks.

## Coffee's Four Enemies
1. **Air** - Causes oxidation and staleness
2. **Light** - Breaks down coffee compounds
3. **Heat** - Accelerates deterioration
4. **Moisture** - Promotes mold and staleness

## Best Storage Practices

### Airtight Containers
Use containers with tight-fitting lids. Glass, ceramic, or non-reactive metal work best.

### Cool, Dark Places
Store in pantry or cabinet away from heat sources. Avoid countertops near stoves.

### Original Packaging
Many coffee bags have one-way valves - these work great if you consume quickly.

### Portion Control
Only buy what you'll use in 2-3 weeks for optimal freshness.

## Storage Mistakes to Avoid

### Never Refrigerate
Cold temps cause condensation which damages beans.

### Never Freeze Whole Bags
Repeated freezing/thawing creates condensation.

### Avoid Clear Containers
Light degrades coffee oils and flavor compounds.

### Don't Pre-Grind
Ground coffee goes stale much faster than whole beans.

## Timeline for Freshness
- **Whole beans**: 2-4 weeks from roast date
- **Ground coffee**: 1 week maximum
- **Opened bag**: Use within 2 weeks

## Pro Storage Tips
- Write roast date on containers
- Buy smaller quantities more frequently
- Use coffee subscription for consistent freshness
- Consider vacuum-sealed containers for long-term storage

Fresh coffee makes all the difference - store it right and taste the improvement!
